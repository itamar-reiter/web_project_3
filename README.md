# web_project_3
From Portland to Portland. An epic bicycle journey from Portland, ME to Portland, OR.
The website goes through the cities of practicum stundents and tutors, offering to buy some artistics pictures.

Tech that were used:
We used grid and flexbox displays for items-location, and media queries for the project's-resnposivity.
We used BEM structure for organizing the files.
